# Arcade-Style Arduino Mini Puzzle Game
If you're like me, you find yourself fighting the urge to push every button, flip every switch, and turn every knob you see. This arcade-style puzzle box was designed to satiate those deep-seated desires. Powered by an Arduino, with completely custom wooden enclosure and components, this is a wood shop geek's first foray into the world of interactivity. For information on how I built the enclosure and a demonstration of how the game works, please see the youtube video linked below. This repository will only focus on parts, wiring, and the code. As always, feel free to contact me on youtube (gradyhillhouse), instagram (gradyhillhouse), or reddit (gradyh) if you have any questions or comments.

## Parts List
The following list covers the major parts I used in the build. Depending on the electrical parts you already own you'll need to season to taste. I've linked to the actual parts I used, when applicable.

1. Arduino Uno
2. Ten LEDs and appropriate resistors
3. Three 10k potentiometers
4. [Two analog panel meters](http://www.allelectronics.com/make-a-store/item/pm-376/panel-meter-full-scale-1ma-dc/1.html) and appropriate resistors
5. A big push button switch
6. [Vibration motor](https://www.adafruit.com/product/1201)
